I am learning to use remote :D
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I want to update it when it has a stable and working structure, or maybe I am stuck, and so on, you deciding is the best way 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks are used to clone repositories from github to github
branches are used only inside a repository between two branches
with clone you can either clone from github to your computer either clone from a computer to another, even more  on the same computer on two different addreses

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Because the GitHub changes you  pull may not be the ones you need and you'll want to discard those.
